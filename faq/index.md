# Frequently Asked Questions
## Who should take computer science?
Everyone should. Serously. No matter what you plan to study after you graduate, computer science can help you. You will improve your ability to think through any problem and solve it. You will also learn how computers and the internet work at the most fundamentatl level, which will give you a basis for learning any new technology.

## Is computer science hard?

Most students find comptuer science challenging, but many have found it to be very rewarding - and fun!

## Which class should I take?

If you are going to be a 10th, 11th, or 12th grader, you should consider taking _Advanced Computer Science_. If you'd prefer to start slowly, you could start with _Introduction to Computer Science_ or _Front-end Web Design and Development_. 

## What are students saying about computer science at THS?

> I have learned more in this class than I ever have in any traditional chemistry or biology course.

> Computer science has invaded my life

> [The lessons I've learned in computer science have] invaded my other courses as well and been a source of GPA boosting techniques

> I’ve seen how my knowledge of computer science has impacted my daily life from understanding certain references on TV and being able to fully understand how websites are created and how WiFi works

> I have discovered a passion for Computer Science that I didn’t know existed before taking this class and I am very glad I took it because it has given me a whole new perspective towards technology and how it works

> I was expecting the course to include less coding, but I was happily surprised that we're doing plenty of coding in multiple languages

> I think I will be less stressed and more committed to spending time on things I enjoy, like solving the computer science problems

> My thinking has changed a lot as a programmer. I enjoy looking at something that seems simple and breaking it down to the components that actually make it work. In this way, physics and computer are very similar, and I have really enjoyed learning in both areas.

> [an assignment in computer science class] concreted my knowledge of the web and made me truly understand how the internet works

> Now that I know some of the code behind everyday technology, it makes me more interested on the abstractions in a new technology I discover

> I’ve also enjoyed learning how the internet works, and I now understand the complex web of operations necessary to allow me to send a single message or access a webpage
