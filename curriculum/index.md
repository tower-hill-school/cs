# Computer Science Curriculum

Recognizing that upper school students arrive in the computer science classroom with a diversity of experience and background, the three computer science courses - _Introduction to Computer Science_, _Computer Science_, and _Advanced Computer Science Principles_ are designed to allow students to progress through the core curriculum following the path that is best for them. 

See the [courses page](courses) for more information about the courses and the material covered in each.
