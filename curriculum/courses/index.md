## Computer Science

### _Introduction to Computer Science_

This semester course, intended for students with a diversity of technological background and experience is a broad overview of computer science and programming, focusing on core concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Students will learn how to think algorithmically and how to solve programming problems efficiently, and will gain familiarity in a number of languages, including C, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

This course covers the material in chapters zero, one, and five of the [core curriculum]({{ "/curriculum/#core-curriculum" | relative_url }}).

### _Advanced Computer Science_

The focus of this course will be on mastery of concepts and languages introduced in Introduction to CS. Students will gain familiarity with several languages, including C, JavaScript, Python, SQL, CSS, and HTML. Students will build several database-driven, web-based applications using Flask, a Python-powered web-development framework.

This course covers the material in chapters zero through eight of the [core curriculum]({{ "/curriculum/#core-curriculum" | relative_url }}). Students who have completed _Introduction to Computer Science_ before this course, which is encouraged, will start with some additional programming problems to review the material from chapters zero and one, which will allow them to select some of the more difficult programming problems in chapters three and four, **if they so choose**.

### _Advanced Computer Science Principles_

Support will be provided to those students who wish to prepare for the AP Computer Science Principles exam in May.

This course reviews the material from chapters zero through eight of the [core curriculum]({{ "/curriculum/#core-curriculum" | relative_url }}) as necessary and covers the material in the [AP modules]({{ "/curriculum/#ap-modules-for-ap-csp"
 | relative_url }}).

## Web Development

### _Front-end Web Design and Development_ 

Led by faculty from the computer science and art departments, students will discover the principles of successful user interface and user experience design (UI/UX), exercise creative project planning, create their own visual designs, and bring their designs to life using the fundamental languages of the web - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Students will also explore modern web development frameworks, including Bootstrap, Backbone, Angular, and React.
